OpenShift Cartridge for Vert.x 3

This project provide a _cartridge_ for OpenShift to run Vert.x 3 applications. The _cartridge_ is based on a _fat jar_ approach, meaning that you provide a _fat jar_ embedding your application.

## Getting started

If you don't have an account, or aren't familiar with OpenShift you can go to Getting Started with OpenShift to help guide you through setting up your environment.

Once our environment is setup we can create our first application (we'll call it demo) using the `rhc` client tools.

The cartridge is not available from OpenShift directly, so you need to pass a couple of parameters. First create your application with

```
rhc create-app demo https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cescoffier/vertx-cartridge/master/metadata/manifest.yml
```

To create an application that scale:

```
rhc create-app demo https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cescoffier/vertx-cartridge/master/metadata/manifest.yml -s
```

This will create a directory named `demo` which contain the Openshift template for your application. The cartridge does not provide any application by default.

## Deploy your application

Your application needs to be prepared to run on OpenShift. Your HTTP server must listen on the port and address given by the following system properties:

* `http.port` - the port on which your server need to bind
* `http.address` - the address on which your server need to bind

Here is an example:

```
vertx.createHttpServer()
    .websocketHandler(ws -> { ws.handler(ws::writeMessage);})
    .requestHandler(req -> {
            if (req.uri().equals("/")) req.response().sendFile("ws.html");
    }).listen(
        Integer.getInteger("http.port"), System.getProperty("http.address"));
```

Important to know is that your application is served on port 80/433 for HTTP, but web sockets are on ports 8000/8433. So you may need to change your web socket clients.

Once your code is ready, build a fat jar, and copy this `-fat.jar` file into the `/demo/application` directory created by `rhc`.

To deploy your application, just launch:

```
git add -A
git commit -m "deploy my application"
git push
```

Your application should now be running !

## Vert.x run options

All Vert.x run options are configured with the `RUN_ARGS` variable in the `configuration/vertx.env` file. For example if you want to specify the number of instances to deploy:

```
export RUN_ARGS="-instances 3"
```

## JVM Parameters and System Properties

You can configure the JVM parameters from the `configuration/vertx.env` file. These parameters are configured from the `VERTX_OPTS` variable. Here is an example:

```
export VERTX_OPTS="-Dfoo=bar"
```

## Retrieving the log and thread dump

You can retrieve the log file of your application using:

```
rhc tail demo -o "-n 200"
```

A thread dump can be generated using:

```
rhc threaddump demo
```

## Clustering


Clustering is supported when the application is scaled through OpenShift when you create your application `rhc create-app <my-app> <url> -s`.

Clustering is enabled from the `configuration/vertx.env` by setting:

```
export HAZELCAST_CLUSTERING=true
```

This will generate the cluster metadata and provide a default `cluster.xml` file. However, if you need to customize this file copy XXX to the `configuration` directory. The cartridge is going to replace the `${env.xxx}` variables.
